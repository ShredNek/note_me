Hi! :)

In order to get this app properly working, you need to do a few things!

1. Install Node - subsequently checking that the NPM & Nodemon are working.
2. Run the app locally.
3. Connect to the server.

INSTALLING NODE/NPM/NODEMON!


---


  /\  /\  /\

STEPS:

- Install Node.js & NPM if you haven't already, on your preferred OS

- Ensure Node/Node Package Manager are updated to the the latest version (access your terminal, type node -v and npm -v to check version & confirm installation)

- install nodemon (i.e. sudo npm i -g nodemon). You will need to use your password when prompted to.

&%&%&

Check if everything's there by going nodemon -v and you should see a number pop up, indicating the version of Nodemon you've downloaded.

RUNNING THE APP LOCALLY!


---


  /\  /\  /\

STEPS:

- Access the terminal

- Change your terminal directory to the main folder of the code you've just downloaded (i.e. cd <pathToFile>/note_me)

- run this command: npm start

&%&%&

If it works, you should see this message pop up in your terminal: Compiled successfully! webpack compiled successfully

CONNECTING TO THE SERVER!


---

  /\  /\  /\

STEPS:

- Open a SEPARATE terminal (we need two terminal windows to run the app)

- Change your terminal directory to the main folder of the code you've just downloaded (i.e. cd <pathToFile>/note_me)

- run this command: nodemon server.js

&%&%&

If it works, you should see this message pop up in your terminal: "we gud! server is running"

  \/  \/  \/



And, voila! You're connected to the note-keeping server and can create/read/update/delete the note database as you please! :)
